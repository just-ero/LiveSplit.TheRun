# LiveSplit component for therun.gg

Check out https://therun.gg/live for currently active runs!

This component does two things:

1. After every reset, it uploads your LiveSplit .lss file to therun.gg. This will automatically sync your runs with the site. No more manual uploading needed. Also works with new runs that haven't been uploaded before to the site.
2. After every split action, sends data about the current run only to therun.gg. This allows therun.gg to keep track of live runs.

## How to install

NOTE: As of March 22nd 2024, the Component is included by default with LiveSplit. No need anymore to download the .dll and insert it into your build. It's already there.

1. Edit your LiveSplit Layout. Create a new Layout entry. The component should be under the "Other"-category and is called therun.gg.
2. Login to therun.gg and hover over your name in the top-right corner. Select Livesplit (or go here: https://therun.gg/livesplit). Copy the key from the clickable box.
3. Back in LiveSplit, edit your Layout once again and select Layout Settings. On the "therun.gg" tab, insert your upload key. Select OK.

That's it! From now on, when you use this layout, your runs will automatically be uploaded to therun.gg.

## LiveSplit Key

Make sure to keep your LiveSplit key secret! Anyone with this key can upload runs on your behalf.
